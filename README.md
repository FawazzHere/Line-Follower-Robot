🤖 Line Follower Robot
An Arduino-powered robot that follows a black path using infrared (IR) sensors. A fun and educational project to learn robotics, sensors, and motor control!

⚙️ How It Works
Two IR sensors continuously scan the ground.

When both sensors detect black:

The robot moves forward.

If the left sensor sees white, it turns right.

If the right sensor sees white, it turns left.

If both sensors see white (off track), it stops.

The logic is handled by Arduino, and motor movement is controlled using an L298N motor driver module.

🧩 Components Used
